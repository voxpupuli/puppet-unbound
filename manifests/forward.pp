#
# Configures a zone for DNS forwarding
#
# == Parameters:
#
# [*address*]
#   (required) IP address of server to forward to. Can be IP 4 or IP 6 (and an
#   array or a single value. To use a nondefault port for DNS communication
#   append  '@' with the port number.
#
# [*zone*]
#   (required) the name of the zone.
#
# [*forward_first*]
#   (optional) If enabled, a query is attempted without the forward clause if
#   it fails.  The data could not be retrieved and would have caused SERVFAIL
